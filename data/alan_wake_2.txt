Follow Casey. Jump down and check out the Mirror Peak sign if you want. Continue down until you see a big Cauldron Campsite welcome sign.

\section{Return 2: Cauldron Lake}

Follow Casey down the path, and talk to the men at the Watch Station. When done, head to the crime scene and look at the table. Then, a little ways west, some footprints. Saga and Casey will split up, so walk down to Witch's Ladle and look at the tree again. You can look at footprints, then approach the tree and burn the darkness away. Take [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Finds a Safe Haven|Saga Finds a Safe Haven]. Head to Witch's Hut and observe the fuse box (it wasn't there before). Walk across the bridge to find a fuse in a blue bin, and place this in the fuse box. You can now enter the Witch's Hut and save your game.

Inside the hut, find [manpage|Manuscript Page 6/: Saga Opens the Cauldron Lake Overlap|Saga Opens the Cauldron Lake Overlap] on a bookshelf and [manpage|Manuscript Page: Dark Poem 1 (Final Draft Only)|Dark Poem 1 (Final Draft Only)] on the table. Use the Mind Palace board and profile Nightingale.

Head to the General Store, and get ready for a fight. After you take out the Taken, you'll find the heart in a refrigerator. On the floor next to a shelf, pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga at the General Store|Saga at the General Store]. Under a shotgun on the wall, find [invexp|Inventory Expansion 1|In the general store]. To get the shotgun, you have to solve a puzzle. Give it a shot, or read on for the solution.

------Solution-------

Look behind the cash register to find lotto numbers and a notepad. If you look at the lotto numbers, 705, 713, 717, and 723 have all already been used. Since the numbers all start with 7, and it says to update it, and since the next number is 39, the combination is 739.

------/Solution-------

You can now pick up [weapon|Shotgun]. Save your game if you want, then head back to Witch's Ladle. Here you'll be attacked by two Taken. After handling them, put the heart into the hole in the sign, and enter the Overlap.

Continue on, and when the place is very red, you can find [manpage|Manuscript Page: Nightingale in the Dark Place|Nightingale in the Dark Place] on the ground near a tree before dropping down to enter a cave. If you miss this one, you can get it later.

Continue until Saga passes through a narrow gap in rock. When Nightingale attacks, hit him with your flashlight and unload into him with your shotgun. After you hurt him, you need to turn around and run away from a tornado. Now you need to continue walking and shooting him until he dies. Keep a look out for supplies on the ground if you need them.

\checklist

\section{Return 2: Cauldron Lake}

After Casey takes Alan away, it's time to do some item collection.

You can close the Murder at Cauldron Lake case.

Note that you can now be attacked at any time by Taken or other creatures. Always be prepared. Do what the game says: save often, as the game won't autosave during this part.

Exit the stage through the curtain. On your left is a door we can't go through. At the end of the hall is a door that needs a combination. You can find it inside the first room on the left. (665).

Inside a store room, you'll find [television|Television: Spiral|Spiral]. Exit across from where you entered, go into the door on the right and toward a door lit in red.

In the attic, look around if you want. Then, use the typewriter.

Interact with the TV again. Exit the stage, following the same path as before. This time the code is spelled out in the blinking numbers (565). Go through the door you went through before and enter the cafeteria. You should hear the janitor singing. Enter the Janitor's Office and talk to Ahti to get [key|Janitor's Key].

For a hallway nearby that says it goes to the stage and take the [map|Map: Talk show studio|Talk show studio map]. Head forward to open the door to the Basement. Head downstairs and find a lit room and take the Lamp.

Head north on Ocean Ave and find the Vision TV Shop on the left with a [television|Television: Writing|Writing].

Head to the flashing subway lamp, and Alan says we need a light. Look west to see a lit up alley. Head down and after the scene take the gun and flashlight.

A nearby light will turn on, so use the lamp and take it.

A path will open up to the southwest with a glowing arrow. These arrows lead to collectibles, so follow it, ducking under a board, and aim up at the circle above the door to get [wopow|Word of Fix|Word of Fix, near where you get the gun]. Going through the door at the end will just loop around.

Head back toward main area. You'll now encounter the main enemy of this section, which are the shadows. Most of the shadows are not hostile; don't waste your flashlight burning them all away. Only use it if they are blocking your way. However, some hide actual enemies that need to be killed. These will attack you, so burn away the shadow and dispatch them.

Go back to Wheeler St., just northwest of the TV Studio. To the right of some phone booths, you should see an arrow pointing to [wopow|Word of Fix|Word of Fix, Wheeler St. just northwest of the TV Studio]. Head to Draft St, east of the plaza, and look up to the overpass to see [wopow|Word of Action|Word of Action, Draft St, east of the plaza].

You can try putting the light into the subway station, but it won't help, because we need two lights to proceed. Instead, head to another flashing light nearby that leads to a stairway going up, and put the light there. Head upstairs. Once on the tracks, go east and climb up a ladder.

To your right, you should see a ladder leading up to a billboard. Align the cicles to get [echo|Echo: Cold Case|Cold Case]. Go back down and through a door leading down some stairs. Here you'll find a break room where you can save. Looking southeast you should see a glowing arrow leading to [wopow|Word of Light|Word of Light, on the rooftops].

Back down the ladder and through the door to back to street level. To the west is a door you can unlock for a shortcut back. Head south to a taxi with its light on. You can take this light, but in doing so the taxi will morph into a police car with its sirens on. This will attract shadows. Either run away or burn them. There's a suitcase nearby hiding near the front of a car with a flashbang if you're having issues. Before going back to the street, go to a little hallway on the east and look up to find [wopow|Word of Gun|Word of Gun, near the police car].

Look around for more supplies if you want, then grab the light you put into the stairway. Use the lights to enter the subway, then use your ticket.

Take the light and view the new scene, to unlock the Murder Cult thread. Place Murder Cult on the Collapsed tunnel.

Slightly east, you'll find a flooded hallway with a lightbulb, so place the light there so you can pass through. Follow the hallway and enter a door to your right when you hear humming to find [breaker|Breaker Room|After the flooded hallway]. Inside you can find another [map|Subway Map|Subway Map in the breaker room] with more points of interest labeled.

Continue down the hall, and when you open the door a shadow will knock you down. Kill him and keep moving into a break room, where you'll find [television|Television: Murder Sites|Murder Sites].

While heading back east, look for a lit car in the center of the station, which has [wopow|Word of Gun|Word of Gun, in a lit car in the center of Shrine St. Station] on it. Now head all the way east to End of the Line. Place Murder cult, then watch the scene and place Summoning Ritual. Head back west and take the light. In a room to the north, slightly west of the exit, find [wopow|Word of ??|Word of ??, a room to the north of Shrine St. Station].
