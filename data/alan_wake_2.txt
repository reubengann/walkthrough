\title{Alan Wake 2}

\section{Introduction}

Welcome to an all-collectibles, mostly spoiler-free guide for Alan Wake 2. This document has a full walkthrough with a route to get all the collectibles that aren't bugged. If you just want the checklists of items, you can go to the "All items by section" or "All items by type" sections. Click the check boxes as you go to keep track of everything (if you want). At the end of each section is a summary of all the collectibles, so you can verify that you got everything. The progress will be stored in your browser's local storage.

There are two modes to play the game: a normal playthrough and The Final Draft, which is only available after you've beaten the game once. There are a few manuscript pages that can only be collected on The Final Draft, and I'll point those out.

There are many clues in the game that are unmissable. When that's the case, I won't point them out.

Puzzle solutions are hidden behind expandable sections. Just click on them to reveal the answer.

Some collectibles are currently bugged and unobtainable, especially some Clues. Some collectibles are missable, so check with the checklist before moving onto new areas.

Alan Wake 2 is a survival horror game. So some things to be aware of that I'm not going to mention in the walkthrough:

\begin{ul}
\item You should always be looking around for items. Check every cabinet, drawer, box, etc. Sometimes these will be marked on the map, and sometimes not.
\item When you get clues or profiling opportunities, you should place them on the Case Board as soon as you can. Sometimes new possibilities only open up once you've done that.
\item Use the Shoebox frequently to store items. Your inventory will fill up quickly.
\item Save often. The game only autosaves at important times, and if you are just running around collecting things, and the game crashes or you quit, you will lose progress.
\item If playing on The Final Draft, I recommend you do not pick up charms that you already have. They fill up the inventory and cannot be disposed of.
\end{ul}

If you find a problem with this guide, please report it at \link{https://github.com/reubengann/walkthrough} in the issues section.

\section{Return 0}

Walk ahead. There's only one path you can take here. Turn right and then continue on the path left. Eventually you'll walk through a big tree. In the next section go all the way to the end and turn right. Head up this path.

\section{Return 1: Invitation: Cauldron Lake}{Return 1}

Walk straight ahead and collect the [map|Cauldron Lake Map].

Follow Casey. Talk to the deputy by the fence (Deputy Mulligan). Proceed through the fence and down the path a little ways, until you come to the case board tutorial.

Follow Casey. Jump down and check out the Mirror Peak sign if you want. Continue down until you see a big Cauldron Campsite welcome sign. Casey will head forward, but go right and head to the Mortar Falls overlook (marked by an icon on your map). You'll see little dreamcatchers hanging on the trees. Look around to find a [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Near the waterfall vista].

Rejoin Casey and follow him to the crime scene. Follow Deputy Thornton to the body. Interact with the body and go to the Mind Place to start a new case The Previous Murders. While you're at it, you can also start the Alex Casey Lunchboxes case.

Interact with the body and find 3 new clues. Place them on the board, then talk to Thornton, and then Casey. Look at the end of the table to see blood. Look at the ground (markers 2 and 3) and on the table (marker 4). Head west around to the other side of the building and enter it. Look at the table to find a [clue|clue|Photo in the general store]. Return to the crime scene and place items on The Previous Murders board. Talk to Thornton and Casey.

Profile Nightingale and place the new clue on the board. Saga will say you should go to the lake.

Time to collect some stuff. Head south of the crime scene to find a trailer. Observe a twig sculpture on the ground to get a [clue|Clue|creepy twig sculpture] and notice the locked box that has a puzzle on it. Inside, pet a [deerhead|Deer Head|Inside the trailer near the crime scene]. Use the clue on the box to find the code.

\begin{spoiler}
\img{stash_1_solution.png}
\end{spoiler}

Open the box [cultstash|Cult Stash|Outside the trailer near the crime scene]. Head to a campsite southwest of the crime scene to find [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Near the Cauldron Lake campground].

Go to Witch's Ladle with Casey. Look at the sign, and then at the tree. You'll get a [clue|clue|Footprints emerging from under rock] and a [manpage|Manuscript Page: The Message|The Message]. Profile Nightingale. Place all the clues on the board.

Before leaving, head to Witch's Hut. As you approach the place to climb up, if you're playing the Final Draft, you can find [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Anderson's Deja Vu|Saga Anderson's Deja Vu (Final Draft only)]. Climb up, then go across a small bridge to the west to find [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Near the Witch's Hut].

Return to the general store and go onto the path east of it, then head north to a landslide. You can find [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Near a landslide] here.

Return to the crime scene and talk to Thornton. You'll get the [key|Shortcut Key]. On your way out, when you see a watch station, walk to the left to find [lunchbox|Lunch Box|By the FBC Monitoring station].

That's it for this section, so head to the car and drive to Bright Falls.

\checklist

\section{Return 1: Invitation: Bright Falls}{Return 1}

Turn around and walk to the other side of a white moving van. This will start [radio|Radio: Tapio's weather report|Tapio's weather report]. Here you'll find [cultstash|Cult Stash|In front of the Elderwood Palace Lodge], which can be solved by Simon Says. Head inside the Elderwood Palace Lodge. Inside you'll find the [map|Great Falls Map] near the door, and [deerhead|Deer Head|Inside the Elderwood Palace Lodge] inside a room marked "Private".

Across from the Oh Deer diner is a sign for a mayoral candidate [settersign|Setter Sign|Across from the Oh Deer diner], which you can read. At a nearby park, look at the base of a tree to find a [lunchbox|Lunch Box|In the Bright Falls Park].

Head into the Oh Deer diner. In the back, behind a door labeled "Employees only" you'll find [deerhead|Deer Head|Inside the Oh Deer diner]. Talk to the Bookers about all topics. You should now be able to close The Previous Murders case and start Cult of the Tree and Cult Stashes.

While heading to the police station, go around the back of the diner and look at the electrical box to find a [clue|Clue|Cult of the Tree: Triangle Graffiti Found around Town]. 

Inside the station, head behind the counter and find the [map|Sheriff's station map|Sheriff's station map]. In a lounge on the first floor, find [koskelatvad|Koskela Ad: Adventure tours|Adventure tours].

Head downstairs. Feel free to loot the lockers at any time, then head into the morgue. Look at the body and follow the prompts. Get [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Fights Nightingale With the Light|Saga Fights Nightingale With the Light] from the body.

Head into the light. Wait for Nightingale to go into the room on the left, then go the other way and get your gun. Shoot Nightingale.

Afterward, talk to Casey, then pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Pursues Nightingale|Saga Pursues Nightingale] on the floor. Use the Mind Place board until you can talk to Casey and say you want to go back to Cauldron Lake. Exit the Sheriff's station.

Across the street, find [radio|Radio: Donna's Jerky review|Donna's Jerky review] playing outside a hardware store. On Coal St find a [settersign|Setter Sign|On Coal St]. Once you're ready, head to the car and drive back to Cauldron Lake.

\checklist

\section{Return 2: Cauldron Lake}{Return 2}

Follow Casey down the path, and talk to the men at the Watch Station. When done, head to the crime scene and look at the table to get [clue|Clue|Triangle Carving on the table]. Then, a little ways west, look at some footprints. Saga and Casey will split up, so walk down to Witch's Ladle and look at the tree again. You can look at footprints, then approach the tree and burn the darkness away. Take [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Finds a Safe Haven|Saga Finds a Safe Haven]. Head to Witch's Hut and observe the fuse box (it wasn't there before). Walk across the bridge to find a fuse in a blue bin, and place this in the fuse box. You can now enter the Witch's Hut and save your game.

Inside the hut, find [manpage|Manuscript Page 6/: Saga Opens the Cauldron Lake Overlap|Saga Opens the Cauldron Lake Overlap] on a bookshelf and [manpage|Manuscript Page: Dark Poem 1 (Final Draft Only)|Dark Poem 1 (Final Draft Only)] on the table. Use the Mind Palace board and profile Nightingale.

Head to the General Store, and get ready for a fight. After you take out the Taken, you'll find the heart in a refrigerator. On the floor next to a shelf, pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga at the General Store|Saga at the General Store]. Under a shotgun on the wall, find [invexp|Inventory Expansion 1|In the general store]. To get the shotgun, you have to solve a puzzle. Give it a shot, or read on for the solution.

\begin{spoiler}

Look behind the cash register to find lotto numbers and a notepad. If you look at the lotto numbers, 705, 713, 717, and 723 have all already been used. Since the numbers all start with 7, and it says to update it, and since the next number is 39, the combination is 739.

\end{spoiler}

You can now pick up [weapon|Shotgun]. Save your game if you want, then head back to Witch's Ladle. Here you'll be attacked by two Taken. After handling them, put the heart into the hole in the sign, and enter the Overlap.

\checklist

\section{Return 2: Overlap}{Return 2}

Head forward until you walk into a tree and loop back around. Turning right, you should see a darkness patch on a big rock. Burn it away to get [manpage|Manuscript Page: Nightingale Enters the Lake|Nightingale Enters the Lake]. Continue on, and when the place is very red, you can find [manpage|Manuscript Page: Nightingale in the Dark Place|Nightingale in the Dark Place] on the ground near a tree before dropping down to enter a cave. If you miss this one, you can get it later.

Continue until Saga passes through a narrow gap in rock. When Nightingale attacks, hit him with your flashlight and unload into him with your shotgun. After you hurt him, you need to turn around and run away from a tornado. Now you need to continue walking and shooting him until he dies. Keep a look out for supplies on the ground if you need them.

\checklist

\section{Return 2: Cauldron Lake}{Return 2}

After Casey takes Alan away, it's time to do some item collection.

You can close the Murder at Cauldron Lake case.

Note that you can now be attacked at any time by Taken or other creatures. Always be prepared. Do what the game says: save often, as the game won't autosave during this part.

Head south along the shore, then east. Hidden in the northeast side of a little bend is [manpage|Manuscript Page: The Overlap|The Overlap]. Cut around, all the way south under a tree branch to find [cultstash|Cult Stash|At the lake shore] with a Simon Says solution. Inside is a [clue|Clue|Note reminding cultists that victims are like animals].

As you pass through the tree back to Witch's Ladle, you'll face a new enemy: wolves. These don't have a dark shield, and it's best to safely shoot them from a distance, since they are very fast.

From where the wolf attacks, head west to a campsite and find [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Burns Away the Dark Substance|Saga Burns Away the Dark Substance] on a table. Then follow the glowing arrows to find the [key|Streamside Stash Key] which opens a nearby [cultstash|Cult Stash|By a bridge] near the table.

From Witch's Hut, head southeast and then northwest to a stream. Following it up to the east you'll find [lunchbox|Lunch Box|At the bottom of a waterfall] by a waterfall. Continue heading west along the stream until it dead-ends. You should see numbers that glow under light. Up on a small ledge is a [cultstash|Cult Stash|Near a creek in the Cauldron Lake area] that requires you to solve a puzzle.

\begin{spoiler}
Code 658
\end{spoiler}

Ignore the private cabin for now and head to Witchfinder station. Once you go up the steps, go to a table nearby to find [manpage|Manuscript Page: The Murder Sites|The Murder Sites]. Follow a nearby path a little ways east to find a [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Outside the ranger cabin].

Approach the front of the station and observe a [rhyme|Nursery Rhyme|Outside the ranger cabin] on the ground to begin the Nursery Rhyme case. Head inside the cabin and interact with the computer and input the code on the post-it to get [clue|Clue: Note from a researcher|Note from a researcher]. On the wall find [deerhead|Deer Head|Inside the ranger cabin]. Upstairs, find [doll|Wolf Doll] and [doll|Hero Doll] and [clue|Clue: FBC File listing test sites in cauldron lake|FBC File listing test sites in cauldron lake] and [clue|Clue: FBI file on reality altering effects|FBC file on reality altering effects].

Solve the nursery rhyme puzzle by placing the dolls to match what the rhyme suggests.

\begin{spoiler}

Put the hero on the boat and the wolf on the tree.

\end{spoiler}

Remember to pick up the dolls when finished, then look at the footprints near the stairs [clue|Clue|A dark substance appears]. Go back to the second floor and find [charm|Coffee Mug World Charm] and get clue [clue|A charm appeared at the site of the rhyme].

Go to the Private Cabin by ducking under a tree trunk. On the left is a generator that will turn on the lights and unlock a break room. Inside you'll find [manpage|Manuscript Page: The Cult of the Tree|The Cult of the Tree]. On a bench outside you will find [doll|Crow Doll] and around the other side [rhyme|Rhyme|Near the bridge].

\begin{spoiler}

Hero on heart, wolf on the house, crow on the hatchling.

\end{spoiler}

Follow the tracks to find [charm|Kalevala Knights Charm] near a big tree.

Head west from the Private Cabin to a picnic site where you'll find a [rhyme|Rhyme|At the river]

\begin{spoiler}

\end{spoiler}

The [charm|Hammer Charm] is on the table.

That's it for this segment. Head back to the car and drive to Bright Falls.

\checklist

\section{Initiation 1: Backstage}{Initiation 1}

Try to leave the room, then go to the TV and follow the prompt.

Exit the stage through the curtain. On your left is a door we can't go through. At the end of the hall is a door that needs a combination. 

\begin{spoiler}
You can find it inside the first room on the left. 665.
\end{spoiler}

Inside a store room, you'll find [television|Writer's Journey: Spiral|Spiral]. Exit across from where you entered, go into the door on the right and toward a door lit in red.

In the attic, look around if you want. Then, use the typewriter.

Interact with the TV again. Exit the stage, following the same path as before. Find the code.

\begin{spoiler}
This time the code is spelled out in the blinking numbers. 565.
\end{spoiler}

Go through the door you went through before and enter the cafeteria. You should hear the janitor singing. Enter the Janitor's Office and talk to Ahti to get [key|Janitor's Key].

As you exit the office, turn right and see a hallway that says it goes to the stage. Take the [map|Map: Talk show studio|Talk show studio map] on the right. Head forward to open the door to the Basement. Head downstairs and find a lit room and take the Lamp.

Use the lamp to take the light overhead, and head south down the newly revealed path. Near a chain-link fence, put the light into the bulb, which will open a new way. Go through the fence and take the light again. Open the door and go up on flight of stairs. Head around this hallway to the right, open two doors in succession and find a TV. Put the light in the TV. You can now save your game. You'll also automatically get [television|Writer's Journey: The Dark Place|The Dark Place].

\checklist

\section{Initiation 2: Caldera Street}{Initiation 2}

Head upstairs and answer the ringing phone to the right. Nearby you'll find the [map|Dark Place Map].

Head north on Ocean Ave and find the Vision TV Shop on the left with a [television|Writer's Journey: Writing|Writing].

Head to the flashing subway lamp, and Alan says we need a light. Look west to see a lit up alley. Head down and after the scene take the gun and flashlight.

A nearby light will turn on, so use the lamp and take it.

A path will open up to the southwest with a glowing arrow. These arrows lead to collectibles, so follow it, ducking under a board, and aim up at the circle above the door to get [wopow|Word of Fix|Word of Fix, near where you get the gun]. Going through the door at the end will just loop around.

Head back toward main area. You'll now encounter the main enemy of this section, which are the shadows. Most of the shadows are not hostile; don't waste your flashlight burning them all away. Only use it if they are blocking your way. However, some hide actual enemies that need to be killed. These will attack you, so burn away the shadow and dispatch them.

Go back to Wheeler St., just northwest of the TV Studio. To the right of some phone booths, you should see an arrow pointing to [wopow|Word of Fix|Word of Fix, Wheeler St. just northwest of the TV Studio]. Head to Draft St, east of the plaza, and look up to the overpass to see [wopow|Word of Action|Word of Action, Draft St, east of the plaza].

You can try putting the light into the subway station, but it won't help, because we need two lights to proceed. Instead, head to another flashing light nearby that leads to a stairway going up, and put the light there. Head upstairs. Once on the tracks, go east and climb up a ladder.

To your right, you should see a ladder leading up to a billboard. Align the cicles to get [echo|Echo: Cold Case|Cold Case]. Go back down and through a door leading down some stairs. Here you'll find a break room where you can save. Looking southeast you should see a glowing arrow leading to [wopow|Word of Lamp|Word of Lamp, on the rooftops]. Head southeast up a small flight of stairs and you should hear someone humming. Enter the door to find [breaker|Breaker Room|On the rooftops]. Inside find [map|Breaker Map 1].

Go across a little bridge. Turn and go up a ladder, then look at the billboard and line up the dots to find [echo|Echo: Hard Case|Hard Case].

Back down the ladder and through the door to back to street level. To the west is a door you can unlock for a shortcut back. Head south to a taxi with its light on. Climb a ladder near here. Around the giant Poet's Cinema sign, on the ground near some trash bags is [wopow|Word of War|Word of War on an elevated walkway near the Poet's Cinema sign.]

Back on the ground, you can take this light, but in doing so the taxi will morph into a police car with its sirens on. This will attract shadows. Either run away or burn them. There's a suitcase nearby hiding near the front of a car with a flashbang if you're having issues. Before going back to the street, go to a little hallway on the east and look up to find [wopow|Word of Gun|Word of Gun, near the police car].

Look around for more supplies if you want, then grab the light you put into the stairway. Use the lights to enter the subway, then use your ticket.

\checklist

\section{Initiation 2: Subway}{Initiation 2}

Align the dots to get a scene [echo|Echo: FBI Agent|FBI Agent]. Use the new story thread the location to open the way.

Now head down the tunnel to a door on your left leading downstairs and find a break room on the right.

Outside, on the right, find the [map|Subway Map]. Facing out of the break room you should see a large "Find Alice" graffiti. Approach it and you should see a glowing arrow pointing to [wopow|Word of Aid|Word of Aid, in the main tunnel].

Go towards the Main Tunnel by passing through a subway car. Here you'll find the Collapsed Tunnel scene. Place the Missing FBI Agent thread on this scene, then view the new scene [echo|Echo: Bad Luck|Bad Luck]. Turn north to where the light is and pass through to a storage room. Behind some shelves on the east wall is [wopow|Word of Lamp|Word of Lamp, in a storage room Behind some shelves].

Take the light and view the new scene, to unlock the Murder Cult thread ([echo|Echo: Murder Cult|Murder Cult]). Place Murder Cult on the Collapsed tunnel.

Slightly east, you'll find a flooded hallway with a lightbulb, so place the light there so you can pass through. Follow the hallway and enter a door to your right when you hear humming to find [breaker|Breaker Room|After the flooded hallway]. Inside you can find  [map|Breaker Map 2|Breaker Map 2] with more points of interest labeled.

Continue down the hall, and when you open the door a shadow will knock you down. Kill him and keep moving into a break room, where you'll find [television|Writer's Journey: Murder Sites|Murder Sites]. Go up the ladder to find The Derailed Train scene. Turn around and head south, under some scaffolding, and around to where you should see some glowing arrows leading to [wopow|Word of War|Word of War, on the ceiling in the Derailed Train scene] on the ceiling.

Add the Murder Cult thread to the scene to open a way west. View a scene and get [echo|Echo: Torchbearers|Torchbearers] thread. Use it on the Derailed Train so you can pass through. On the other side, you can turn right to unlock a door. Head the other way and down a ladder. Turn around and go into the room and shoot the cardboard to find [wopow|Word of Action|Word of Action, down a ladder after Derailed Train]. Then go down a small stairway. On your left is a room behind bars with several enemies. Clear them out and claim the [wopow|Word of Fix|Word of Fix, above the booth] above the booth.

Head down into the flooded tunnel with a break room. Take the two lights, then go into a little gated part that used to be fully enclosed and put one of the lights back. Head through the hall and put a light in at the end, then backtrack. Take this light again and you can pass into Shrine St. Station.

Turn left and head west as far as you can. You find [wopow|Word of Lamp|Word of Lamp, in a flooded part of Shrine St. Station] on a wall to the left.

While heading back east, look for a lit car in the center of the station, which has [wopow|Word of Gun|Word of Gun, in a lit car in the center of Shrine St. Station] on it. Now head all the way east to End of the Line. Place Murder cult, then watch the scene to get [echo|Echo: Summoning Ritual|Summoning Ritual]. Place Summoning Ritual in this scene, and head back west and take the light from the subway car when you are outside of it.

In a room to the north, slightly west of the exit, find [wopow|Word of Action|Word of Action, a room to the north of Shrine St. Station]. Head north through the exit with some enemies. In this large room you can get [echo|Echo: Markings|Markings]. Then take the stairway up. There's a [wopow|Word of Fix|Word of Fix, behind the closed gate while exiting Shrine St. Station] behind the closed gate at the top. Continue, using the break room if you want, then head north back into the main tunnel.

We're about to leave, so make sure you got everything.

\checklist

You might want to save your game here. Then head back to Collapsed Tunnel scene. First, use Torchbearers here to get [echo|Echo: The Tree|The Tree]. Then use the Summoning thread on it. You now need to run back to the break room. Once the Dark Presence disappears, return to the tunnel and head through.

Approach the heart and interact with it.

Head through the tunnel, get [echo|Echo: Something in the Air|Something in the Air], and then back out onto the main street. Parliament Tower is ahead.

Just proceed up some ledges into the park.

In a break room you'll find [manpage|Manuscript Page: Scratch on the Hunt|Scratch on the Hunt]. Head to the gift shop. Go around to the front door, and check the bulletin board next to it to find 2 clues. Next to the Slow Roaster is a [cultstash|Cult Stash|By the Ferris Wheel]. Solve the puzzle.

Head down the hill to the break room with a [settersign|Setter Sign|In front of the trailer park] in front of it. Then enter the park.

Next to Odin and Thor you should see some dreamcatchers, so look around for a [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Found in the Watery Trailer Park]. Inside trailer #1 you can find [koskelatvad|Koskela Ad: Parade Floats|Parade Floats] and [deerhead|Deer Head|Trailer #1].

Investigate Saga's trailer, picking up all the clues. Two are in Saga's bedroom: [clue|Book of Pun Jokes from Ilmo] and [clue|Letter from Agent Marrow]. One is on the kitchen table [clue|Clue: Birthday card from Mom to Logan|Birthday card from Mom to Logan]. Three are in Logan's room ([clue|Clue: Children's book - Nordic Tales|Children's book - Nordic Tales], [clue|Clue: Poster in Logan's Room|Poster in Logan's Room], [clue|Clue: Junior FBI Agent|Junior FBI Agent]). Look at the newspaper to progress.

Pursue the new Taken to the Kalevala Knights Workshop.

Before going inside, look around the far side for a derelict boat with dreamcatchers to find [lunchbox|Lunch Box|Near the workshop]. Going inside, on the left side of the workshop, find [manpage|Manuscript Page: Deputies Make A Grave Mistake|Deputies Make A Grave Mistake] on a workbench. In the back of the workshop, find a [deerhead|Deer Head|Inside the workshop].

Go inside the office to find a lock. Look at the computer and read all the messages to get [clue|Clue: OOP|OOP] and to see that the combination is inside the giant smiling coffee cup. 

\begin{spoiler}
Standing behind the cup will reveal the combination. up triangle/down triangle stacked, up down left to right but overlapping, down up stacked.
\img{stash_3_solution.png}
\end{spoiler} 

Use the combination to open the lock.

Inside the break room, collect clues from the bulletin board ([clue|Ritual being interrupted], [clue|Steps of the cult ritual], [clue|Admonishing members sabotaging FBC equipment]) and from the table ([clue|Report on Rose Marigold], [clue|Drug-fueled scribbles]). You can pick up a fuse from the table. Then head down into the basement.

Try to take the Clicker. On the floor is [manpage|Manuscript Page: Saga Fights Taken At The Workshop|Saga Fights Taken At The Workshop]. Go ahead and profile the deputies. Go upstairs and kill the Taken. Outside, find [manpage|Manuscript Page: The Koskela's Parade Float|The Koskela's Parade Float] on the ground in front of the float. On the nearby table, find a legal pad with some clues. Profile the Koskelas. Also get all the clues on the float.

We need to collect several objects to proceed:
\begin{ul}
	\item The Moose Mask, at the well
	\item The Cassette Tape, in the Fair trade area, behind a laughing sign
	\item The Toy Knife in gift shop
	\item The Circuit Board, at the Espresso Express. Use the fuse from the workshop on the fusebox on the right side of the ride and then go underneath by stopping the ride at the right time.
\end{ul}

Make sure to take [manpage|Manuscript Page: Deputies Corrupted|Deputies Corrupted] on the ground exiting the Espresso Express after getting the Circuit Board. 

\checklist

\section{Watery Overlap}{Return 3}

Proceed forward through a tunnel.

Inside the cabin, pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: Deputies In The Morgue|Deputies In The Morgue]. Follow the boards here behind the cabin to another well, and go down the ladder. In the second loop, pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: Mocha's Funeral|Mocha's Funeral] from the table. Continue forward to the well again, and after interacting with it, take the path behind it. Continue following Ahti's voice, which will cut out when you reach the right place. Eventually you will be confronted by 3 enemies. Proceed through a nearby cave tunnel and down the well again.

Continue on the only path for a boss fight. Try not to shoot the enemies any more than you need to. The real goal is to run around the arena and use your flashlight on the dark orbs. If you kill the deputies before getting rid of all the orbs, they will respawn.

This closes the "Trail of the Cult" case.

Behind Trailer #4 is a [cultstash|Cult Stash|Trailer park, behind Trailer #4] and the [key|Trailer Park Stash Key] for it is obtained by walking up a small ramp near the grill and taking it off the electrical box.

Use the newly repaired bridge to walk east back into the town. At the end of the westernmost pier is [manpage|Manuscript Page: The Dark Presence Attacks|The Dark Presence Attacks]. The easternmost pier has a [cultstash|Cult Stash|Downtown Watery, the easternmost pier], which you can get by solving a short math puzzle.

\begin{spoiler}

1600 amps. B2 has 128 amps more than B3. B1 has twice as much as B3.

B1 + B2 + B3 = 1600
B2 = B3 + 128
B1 = 2 B3

Find B2.

{3 B3 + B2 = 1600
{B2 = B3 + 128
=>
3 (B2 - 128) + B2 = 1600

Looking the other way, can just about get [wopow|Word of Lamp|Word of Lamp on a water tower] on a water tower. Rather than open this door, go the left and down some stairs. Ducking under a nearby stairway, you eventually you should see a [wopow|Word of Gun|Word of Gun on the underside of a stairway landing] on the underside of a stairway landing. Go the other way, south and down a ladder, and on your left is a [breaker|Breaker Room|On the rooftops]. Take [map|Breaker Map 3].

Return to the door, place the light, and pass through. Return, and take the light again. Go through the door and on the other side, with the water tower, place the light to make the tower disappear. Return and put the light in again. You can now pass through and walk around to the hotel room entrance.

Before we tackle this, go to where the other water tower is and you should see some orbs to align. This shows you [echo|Echo: Final Case|Final Case].

We need a code to enter.

\begin{spoiler}
Head to a nearby rooftop bar and put the light in through the barrier. Look at the board to see that the Oceanview Cocktail is 25.50. The code is 2550.
\end{spoiler}

Before you go, take the light out while inside the bar. You'll find the [weapon|Double barreled Shotgun] on the rack. Enter the code into the door to proceed. Use the key, turn on the projector, and interact with the picture.

\begin{spoiler}

The ceremony takes place on the day after the next new moon. We can tell by the entry in the book that it's around the 16th of August. Looking at the calendar, the new moon is on the 16th, so the 17th is the day after that, and the Koskela brothers put dates in European style (day/month/year). The code is therefore 170823.

\end{spoiler}

On the computer's mail you can get a hint that the doorknob for the room at the end of the hall is "in a glassy cage where pretty flowers bloom near the greet". On the media tab you'll get a clue. Then use the security tab and unlock the doors. The nearby shortcut to the lobby is now open.

On a side table is a heart shaped box with a [clue|Clue: Box of chocolate from Tor|Box of chocolate from Tor], and on another table a [clue|Clue: An entry from Cythia's journal|An entry from Cythia's journal]. In the bathroom is [manpage|Manuscript Page: Cynthia And Tor|Cynthia And Tor]. Get the record from the bathtub, then head downstairs. Kill the Taken here and then use the jukebox.

\checklist

Enter the Overlap. There are no Manuscript Pages here, so just keep going down the path. In the first loop, ignore all the doors and just keep going in the hallway until you go down some stairs. Kill a Taken and start a generator, then go back one room and flip a switch. Head through the chain link door.

In the second loop, go into door 3. You'll reach a dead end, so backtrack to the hallway and head back the way you came, up some stairs. You'll come to a room with another switch and a locked cabinet. Flip the switch, enter the door, then flip another switch, and check a nearby desk drawer for [key|Tool Cabinet Key]. Back in the previous room, turn the light back off and retrieve the Boltcutters from the cabinet. Now turn the light on again and re-enter the next room. Turn the light off and kill the Taken that appears. Then use the boltcutters to unlock the door. Down the ladder, in the third loop, continue till you reach a big flooded room.

In here, do not stay in the water for long! Cynthia is down there and will kill you. Run into the center of the room. Try the panel. Use the platforms to make your way clockwise around the room to an opening. Here, in the outer ring, you need to make your way counterclockwise. In the third opening on the right, activate a generator. Directly across from you on a scaffold is a shortcut back to the center room.

Get ready to fight Cythia, then hit the button. Go down the stairs. Don't worry about the water here, Cynthia is above water. Run around and shoot her with the rifle. She will throw damaging projectiles at you that you need to dodge, and eventually will close and attack you hand-to-hand. Keep your distance and keep shooting.

Profile Tor. This closes the case The Anderson Brothers.

Walk toward the Hotel. On the way, align the orbs to get an [echo|Echo|Thomas Zane]. Head up the elevator and use the projector. On the way out you can see [television|Television: Collaboration|Collaboration] in a reception booth in the lobby (listen for static).

\section{Initiation 8: Zane's Film}{Initiation 8}

Head toward the car wash and burn away the 3 dark orbs. Inside the garage, go under the sliding door. Turn left, and on this side of the building, under an arch, find [wopow|Word of Aid|Word of Aid Outside the cinema, to the east, near a ladder. It's near an arch]. Climb up a nearby ladder and look up at the sign to align orbs for [echo|Echo: Murder Case|Murder Case].

Back on the ground, across the street from this, behind a chain link fence, you can look in the window and see a dark orb. Burn it away, then on the street side burn away 3 more in the same room. Duck back under the shutter and enter the door to find a [breaker|Breaker Room] with [map|Breaker Map 5].

Enter the cinema. In the back of the concession stand, in a kitchen, is the [map|Poet's Cinema Map]. Enter a break room west of here and see [television|Television: Stop writing|Stop writing].

Go south through a gate. Turn left and swing around an AC unit to see a few steps leading down. Duck under the walkway. Follow this path around until you find the final [breaker|Breaker Room|On the Poet's Cinema Roof] and [map|Breaker Map 6]. Leave the other way, unlocking a door. As you exit, look up at the water tower to collect [wopow|Word of Lamp|Word of Lamp on a water tower on the roof].

Go right, past a break room, and down a ladder. Here use the Cult of the Word thread. Align the orbs to get [echo|Echo: Death of a Cultist|Death of a Cultist] and the Grandmaster story thread.

Back as Saga, head to the Bright Falls Sheriff Station.

\section{Return 6: Scratch}{Return 6}

\end{spoiler}

On the Final Draft, pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: Breakthrough in the Lake House|Breakthrough in the Lake House (Final Draft only)]. Talk to Estevez. On the computer here you can get a [clue|Clue|Email about newly installed electronic locks]. Head to the cells.

In the first cell on the right pick up the [manpage|Manuscript Page: Sheriff's Station Attacked|Sheriff's Station Attacked]. Approach Alan in the last cell on the right, and get ready for some action.

Turn around and exit outside. The goal in this section is to damage him enough until he has to heal. When he does, quickly move to the red boxes and power them up. Don't even both trying to power them up when he's active. Two or three rifle shells is enough to stun him. After activating all three boxes, you'll see a scene.

In the Tim Breaker's office, speak to Casey and profile. Talk to Estevez and get the [key|Prison Cell Key]. Use it to open a cell on the left in the jail. Inside look at the files to get some clues.

\section{Return 7: Summoning}{Return 7}

Drive to Cauldron Lake. We need to head to the shore, but many of the previous routes are blocked, and there are many Taken to fight. Go through the fence. As you head through the paths, Tor and Odin will open the way with their van. The path will take you along the stream, then across a bridge. Before you jump down to the shoreline, pick up [manpage|Manuscript Page: It's Not a Lake|It's Not a Lake].

Talk to Tor to start the fight. There are many waves of Taken. Casey and Estevez will do most of the work to light up the Taken, but you may need to burn some yourself. It's very helpful to have the rifle upgrade that allows you to shoot the Taken without burning away the darkness. There's a final wave near the end that you should probably use a grenade on once they converge on the van. Otherwise just keep shooting until the red light appears, then approach it and use the clicker.

\section{Initiation 9: Gone}{Initiation 9}

Go up the elevator. Try to enter the door with the sign, and then go through the door on the left and walk around to interact with the screen and get [television|Television: Part 3|Part 3].

Once that happens, run to the nearest light and hold the button. After you activate both, run inside the cage.

Talk to Estevez and pick up the weapons. Duck under the fallen tree and make your way on the only available path back to the car. There will be several Taken along the way. At the end, drop down and use the car to drive to Bright Falls.

At the nursing home, try to enter. Turn around and see a door with a light. Use it to enter the back of the Wellness Center. Move through to the entrance until you encounter Scratch. Turn around and run, taking every left path, until you reach a lit room, then continue through to the entry area and out into the Nursing Home. Head to the third floor and enter the door with the spiral on it.

Look at the typewriter and the board, then align the orbs. Put the new thread on the board.

Try to leave the Mind Place via the door. Then use the case board. Profile Saga. Continue looking at objects, placing them on the board, and profiling to find all the of ways Saga has failed. When the room gets dark, get the flashlight from the central table. Burn away dark orbs and look at the objects that remind Saga of good qualities. Continue profiling and using the board until the case is closed.

\section{Return 9: Come Home}{Return 9}

Answer the payphone. Walk around the perimeter of the square to find Tim Breaker. After talking with him, he'll give you the final [manpage|Manuscript Page: Door Traverses The Dark Place|Door Traverses The Dark Place]. Across the square is a door you can open with some stairs going down. This door takes you to the subway, so walk through and exit out back to Caldera St. In the plaza, fight several Taken and take the objects from the shoe box. Talk to Alan in the Mind Place, then go back the way we came, through the subway, to the fountain. Enter it by walking down the steps.
