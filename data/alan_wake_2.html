   Initiation 1: Backstage
  </h2>
  <p>
   Try to leave the room, then go to the TV and follow the prompt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exit the stage through the curtain. On your left is a door we can't go through. At the end of the hall is a door that needs a combination. You can find it inside the first room on the left. (665).
  </p>
  <p>
   Inside a store room, you'll find
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Television: Spiral.
   </label>
   Exit across from where you entered, go into the door on the right and toward a door lit in red.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the attic, look around if you want. Then, use the typewriter.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interact with the TV again. Exit the stage, following the same path as before. This time the code is spelled out in the blinking numbers (565). Go through the door you went through before and enter the cafeteria. You should hear the janitor singing. Enter the Janitor's Office and talk to Ahti to get

   </label>
   Head forward to open the door to the Basement. Head downstairs and find a lit room and take the Lamp.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use the lamp to take the light overhead, and go down the newly revealed path. Near a chain-link fence, put the light into the bulb, which will open a new way. Go through the fence and take the light again. Open the door and go up on flight of stairs. Head around this hallway, open a two doors in succession and find a TV. Put the light in the TV. You can now save your game.

   Head north on Ocean Ave and find the Vision TV Shop on the left with a
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Television: Writing.
   </label>
  </p>
  <p>
   Head to the flashing subway lamp, and Alan says we need a light. Look west to see a lit up alley. Head down and after the scene take the gun and flashlight.
  </p>
  <p>
   A nearby light will turn on, so use the lamp and take it.
  </p>
  <p>
   A path will open up to the southwest with a glowing arrow. These arrows lead to collectibles, so follow it, ducking under a board, and aim up at the circle above the door to get
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Word of Fix.
   </label>
   Going through the door at the end will just loop around.
  </p>
  <p>
   Head back toward main area. You'll now encounter the main enemy of this section, which are the shadows. Most of the shadows are not hostile; don't waste your flashlight burning them all away. Only use it if they are blocking your way. However, some hide actual enemies that need to be killed. These will attack you, so burn away the shadow and dispatch them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Go back to Wheeler St., just northwest of the TV Studio. To the right of some phone booths, you should see an arrow pointing to
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Word of Fix.
   </label>
   Head to Draft St, east of the plaza, and look up to the overpass to see
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Word of Action.
   </label>
  </p>
  <p>
   You can try putting the light into the subway station, but it won't help, because we need two lights to proceed. Instead, head to another flashing light nearby that leads to a stairway going up, and put the light there. Head upstairs. Once on the tracks, go east and climb up a ladder.
  </p>
  <p>
   To your right, you should see a ladder leading up to a billboard. Align the cicles to get
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Echo: Cold Case.
   </label>
   Go back down and through a door leading down some stairs. Here you'll find a break room where you can save. Looking southeast you should see a glowing arrow leading to
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Word of Light.
   </label>
   Head southeast up a small flight of stairs and you should hear someone humming. Enter the door to find
   <input type="checkbox"/>

    Breaker Room.
   </label>
   Inside find the
   <input type="checkbox"/>

   Go across a little bridge. Turn and go up a ladder, then look at the billboard and line up the dots to find
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Echo: Hard Case.
   </label>
  </p>
  <p>
   Back down the ladder and through the door to back to street level. To the west is a door you can unlock for a shortcut back. Head south to a taxi with its light on. You can take this light, but in doing so the taxi will morph into a police car with its sirens on. This will attract shadows. Either run away or burn them. There's a suitcase nearby hiding near the front of a car with a flashbang if you're having issues. Before going back to the street, go to a little hallway on the east and look up to find
   <input type="checkbox"/>
   <label>
    Word of Gun.
   </label>
  </p>
  <p>
   Look around for more supplies if you want, then grab the light you put into the stairway. Use the lights to enter the subway, then use your ticket.

Eventually you will be confronted by 3 enemies. Proceed through a nearby cave tunnel and down the well again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continue on the only path for a boss fight. Try not to shoot the enemies any more than you need to. The real goal is to run around the arena and use your flashlight on the dark orbs. If you kill the deputies before getting rid of all the orbs, they will respawn.
